           It is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine. It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML, and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. By May 2015, mobile search had surpassed desktop search.

    			<h1 class="page-title">Guidelines on how to read a Search Engine Results Page</h1>
    			<p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behavior, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.</p>
                <p>
                    If you believe that another site is abusing Google's quality guidelines, please let us know by filing a spam report. Google prefers developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, so we attempt to minimize hand-to-hand spam fighting. While we may not take manual action in response to every report, spam reports are prioritized based on user impact, and in some cases may lead to complete removal of a spammy site from Google's search results. Not all manual actions result in removal, however. Even in cases where we take action on a reported site, the effects of these actions may not be obvious.

    				A good way of making the content found in your website more relevant to what potential customers want. 
    			</p>
    			<p>By placing your business in the various search engines, SEO makes it easier for people to have as much information as they would want regarding your business. It is also a good way of making your website more attractive, thus increasing readability and the amount of time people spend on the page, which is also valuable.  Through the use of good and reliable software, search engines serve their purpose much more effectively.

                    Indeed, we don’t actually know the exact formula and there’s an entire industry of people trying their very best to figure it out and then remarket the specific tactics and layout suggested by their experimental data (and guesses). They’re Search Engine Optimizer (SEO) specialists and while some of them are sharp marketing professionals, many are snake-oil salesmen and should be avoided at all costs.

                <h1 class="page-title">Important SEO Expectations</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed of Ranking Increases</li>
                        <p>When SEO is done right, rankings will increase. The speed of the increase is something that the SEO specialist only has so much control over. There are many factors at work that it’s difficult to make good judgments on how long it will take for a keyword to hit a certain page or position, given that there may be others going after similar keywords with more resources to devote.</p>
                    <li>Number of Keywords Targeted</li>
                        <p>Clients want to rank for everything, but most clients aren’t willing to pay to rank for everything at once. And even when they recognize that their SEO budget leaves them shy of being able to tackle some highly competitive terms, they’ll inevitably try to get them onto the keyword research list.</p>
                    <li>Quantity of Blacklinks</li>
                        <p>SEO companies should be reporting on the backlinks they’re requesting and successfully building. Clients have come to expect this. But when clients start calculating their “cost per link” and talk about quitting in favor of “cheaper links” from another country, you know there’s a disconnect.</p>
                    <li>Quality of Blacklinks</li>
                        <p>If they’re not concerned about quantity, clients are concerned about the quality of backlinks (or most certainly both). This is more than understandable. After all, after the initial on-page optimization, the effort moves almost entirely to the off-page efforts.</p>
                    <li>Amount of Traffic</li>
                        <p>Clients really like to see site traffic increases that correspond to ranking increases, and as an SEO, this is one of the easiest things to guarantee. Where clients get disappointed is when they’ve gone through the trouble to make projections about how much traffic will come from their rankings based on search volumes and calculate click-through and it doesn’t happen. Very rarely will a client’s own projected traffic be exceeded by the actual results. The truth is that whether you’re at #1 or #21, it just doesn’t happen. Charts like those shown below (2006 data from AOL) create an opiate-like sense of secure predictability for SEO clients that inevitably turns into a pipe dream.</p>
                    <li>Number of Leads</li>   
                        <p>From an SEO’s point of view, the basic objective of a campaign is to increase relevant keyword rankings, which should result in site traffic, which should result in leads, which should result in sales, which should result in enough profit to justify the campaign expense. There are a lot of “shoulds” in there. Often, clients don’t internalize all of the possible failure points, not to mention the fractions involved. All they internalize is that SEO will get their phones ringing and their pockets lined.</p>
                    <li>Client Impact of Success</li>
                        <p>An SEO campaign without a client’s dedicated investment of time and attention will inevitably fail, regardless of who’s running the show. Clients often don’t understand just how critical they are to the success of their own campaign, even while they’re hiring someone else to do the job.</p>
